[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/zalando-stups/log-sink/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/zalando-stups/log-sink)
[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/zalando-stups/log-sink.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/zalando-stups/log-sink)

This application is supposed to serve as a central sink for audit- and traceability relevant log files in the STUPS ecosystem,
such as the taupage.yaml and logs files written by audit daemon in Taupage hosts.

The current implementation is a proxy that forwards all matching requests to Fullstop. If a request contains a taupage.yaml file
it will send a corresponding event including the taupage.yaml data to zalando's audit system.
