This application is supposed to serve as a central sink for audit- and traceability relevant log files in the STUPS ecosystem,
such as the taupage.yaml and logs files written by audit daemon in Taupage hosts.

The current implementation is only a proxy that forwards all matching requests to Fullstop.
